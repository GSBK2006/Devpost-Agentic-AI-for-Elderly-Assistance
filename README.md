Inspiration: We noticed seniors struggling with daily tasks like taking medicines, booking appointments, or managing payments, while families constantly worry about their safety.

Solution: Our Elderly Assistance AI Companion provides voice-friendly reminders, appointment scheduling, bill management, and emergency alerts, keeping seniors independent and families reassured.

Prototype: The uploaded files showcase a working prototype that integrates speech recognition, reasoning (LLM), and action tools, performing tasks autonomously while logging updates for caregivers.

Challenges & Learnings: We addressed multi-language support, privacy, secure payments, and accessibility, learning how agentic AI can perform actions, not just assist.

Next Steps: Plans include wearable integration, expanded medical knowledge, lightweight device deployment, and real-world pilot testing with clinics and communities.
